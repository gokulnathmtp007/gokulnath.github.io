🔬 Featured Research
1️⃣ Bioaccumulation of Zinc Using Microbial Methods
- Investigating zinc uptake efficiency of bacterial-alginate consortia.
- Quantified using **Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)**.
- Demonstrates high removal efficiency across 48–120 hrs incubation.

2️⃣ Bacteriocin Screening and Anticancer Property Study
- Isolation and purification of bacteriocins from soil-derived microbes.
- Evaluated for anticancer activity and in silico docking behavior.
- Involves "SwissADME", "ShinyGO", and "network pharmacology" pipelines.
