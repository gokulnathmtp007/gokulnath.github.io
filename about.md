I am an Applied Microbiologist specializing in microbial physiology, metal bioaccumulation, and environmental biotechnology.  
My current research focuses on "*bioaccumulation of zinc using microbial consortia*" and "*bacteriocin screening with anticancer potential*".  

I aim to integrate molecular biology, microbial genetics, and bioinformatics to design sustainable biotechnological solutions.
